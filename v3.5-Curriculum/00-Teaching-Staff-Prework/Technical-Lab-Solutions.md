## Technical Lab Setup

Technical labs begin in Week 3 of the program. The majority of the following weeks are hands-on. 

We will use a combination of web labs and cloud-hosted VMs, with certain weeks using our web lab virtual machine solution and other weeks using our cloud-hosted solution on Azure Lab Services. 


### Web Lab Virtual Machine

You and students will use web lab virtual machines in the following units: 
* Module 3: Terminal and Bash
* Module 4: Linux Systems Administration Fundamentals
* Module 5: Archiving and Logging Data
* Module 6: Bash Scripting and Programming
* Module 8: Networking Fundamentals
* Module 9: Networking Fundamentals II and CTF

#### Distributing Web Lab Credentials


- In Module 2, Day 3, you will demonstrate how to log in to the web lab.  Login credentials will need to be distributed to students in order for them to be able to access the web lab. 

You and students will start using the web lab in class in Module 3, Day 1. 


### Azure Lab Services

Some weeks require environments with multiple machines. We host these technical labs on Microsoft Azure, which you and students will first use during the Windows Module in Week 7. You will use Azure Lab Services for the following modules:

  * Module 7: Windows Administration and Hardening
  * Module 11: Network Security
  * Module 16: Penetration Testing I
  * Module 17: Penetration Testing II
  * Module 18: Project 2
  * Module 21: Forensics

Please refer to the Azure Training Sequence in the GitHub curriculum repository for detailed documentation and troubleshooting help. 

#### Distributing Azure Access and Credentials

- You will see your Azure credentials on the Admin portal when you receieve the Web Lab Credentials. The Azure credentials are needed for students to sign into the Student Portal and are the same credentials for their Azure labs. 

  * Please verify that credentials for all instructors, students, and TAs are on your Admin portal. If they are not, please submit a Cyber Lab Support workflow via the 05-cyber channel. 

- During Lesson 6.3, you will demonstrate to students how to set up Azure. Please follow the steps in the lesson plan very carefully. After the demonstration, distribute the login credentials to students. Please use office hours after class to make sure everyone is setup with Azure. 

- In Module 7: Windows, you and students will use Azure for the first time. 

- Please make sure to go through the **Up and Running with Azure** training sequence prior to Module 7. 


### Personal Azure Accounts

You and students will use personal Azure accounts in the following modules: 
* Module 12: Cloud Security 
* Module 13: Project 1

#### Personal Azure Account Setup for Students 

- In Module 11, Day 3, students will create free, personal Azure accounts. You should do this as well. You can find a setup guide [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gs_09b7eotl7hzTL82xlqPt-OwOd0aWA78qcQxtMr6Y/edit). 

- In Module 12, you and students will use your personal Azure accounts. Please make sure everyone is logged into these accounts and on `portal.azure.com`  No one should be logged into their cyberxsecurity accounts. 

- In Module 13, you and students will continue to use these personal Azure accounts for the first project week.
