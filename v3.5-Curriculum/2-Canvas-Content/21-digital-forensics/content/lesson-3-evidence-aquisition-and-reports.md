## Lesson 3: Evidence Acquisition and Reports 
 
### Overview

Today we will conclude our introduction to digital forensics. You will continue investigating Peter's iPhone by examining emails, SMS messages, and web history, and then you'll produce a preliminary log and report on the evidence that you found.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:

- Use Autopsy to view and gather evidence from Peter's emails.

- Use data exports to analyze email messages offline.

- Use data exports to analyze SMS messages offline.

- Use Autopsy to extract GPS data and identify WiFi locations.

- Prepare a preliminary report using evidence worksheets.

### Today’s Activities

* **Email Export:** In these activities, you will continue your role as a digital forensics investigator. In this activity, you will export the email database for offline analysis using examination tools outside of Autopsy. 

* **Peter's Email Evidence:** In this activity, you will use Autopsy to view Peter's email correspondence and generate a list of contacts and their email addresses. You will create custom tags for the evidence in Autopsy and document your findings using the Correspondence Evidence Worksheet.

* **Peter's SMS Messages:** In this activity, you will examine Peter's SMS messages and gather more information about the case, keeping your Correspondence Evidence Worksheet updated with your findings. You will also export the `sms.db` file so that team members in other departments can use third-party software to perform analysis.

* **The Final Report:** In this activity, you will conclude your investigation by analyzing your findings and preparing a final report. Whatever you do not finish in class, you will continue working on at home as part of this week's Challenge deliverable.
