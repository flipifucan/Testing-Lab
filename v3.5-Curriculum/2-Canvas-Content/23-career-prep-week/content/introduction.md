## Introduction to Module 23

### Career Prep Week

In this module, we will focus on one of the most popular cybersecurity certifications: **Security+**. We will cover subject matter overviews, exam requirements, and test-taking strategies. On Day 2, we will explore some strategies for searching for IT security jobs and job networking. On Day 3, we'll focus on the interview process for cybersecurity jobs.

### What to Be Aware Of

On Day 1, we will use the CompTIA CertMaster Practice Tool Trial. You will need to sign up for a free account, but wait till you are advised to do so as there is a 30 day access limit.
