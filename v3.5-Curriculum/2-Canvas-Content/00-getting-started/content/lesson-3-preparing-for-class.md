## Lesson 3: Orientation Introduction

### Overview

Here is an overview of how the course materials are organized:
- Each week of the boot camp covers approximately one module.
- Within each module, there are two to four lessons. Most modules contain three lessons. Each lesson takes place during one class session.
- You'll get access to each module’s materials one week in advance.
- Before the start of each class session, log in and navigate to that week’s module.
- Click on the lesson for that day (for example, Lesson 1.1 or Lesson 1.2) and you'll find information about that day's class and activity.
     
The videos in the following lessons will provide an overview of information to help you get ready for class. Don’t forget to complete the quiz at the end of the module and view the additional resources!
