## Introduction to Module 19

### SIEM

In this module, we will focus on one of the most popular types of software that security professionals use to monitor their environments: **SIEM**, which stands for **security information and event management**. While many different SIEM vendors exist in today's marketplace, we will primarily focus on one vendor: Splunk. This week we will learn about Splunk's core functionalities, and next week we will preview Splunk's SIEM product, Splunk Enterprise Security.

This first of two modules dedicated to SIEM will include the following:

- Day 1 will cover why and how businesses monitor their environment, how they use alerts to detect security events, and what makes SIEM such a powerful product for managing the many challenges of security monitoring.
- Day 2 will introduce a big data analysis tool called Splunk. We will learn how to use Splunk's Search and Reporting application to create basic and complex Splunk searches.
- Day 3 will build on the concepts covered on Day 2, exploring Splunk's reporting and alerting capabilities. We will also learn about the importance of "good" alerts and how to build them.

### What to Be Aware Of

At the end of Day 1, you will start to set up your Splunk environment inside of your web lab. Be sure to attend office hours before Day 2 if you have any issues accessing the Splunk application.
