# Introduction to Module 3

## Introduction to Module 3

### Terminal and Bash

In this module, you will gain technical hands-on experience by using Bash and the command line. Learning the command line can be challenging, but it is an absolutely vital skill for IT and cybersecurity professionals.

We will begin with basic file navigation and retrieval. Then, we'll expand into file searching, combining commands, and adding command options. Finally, we'll use text processing and text editing to develop a custom command-line script.

### What to Be Aware Of

* Practice makes perfect! This is the first technical, hands-on module of the course, and it can take some hard work to adjust to. Take the time you need to practice and get used to working on the command line.

### Security+ Domains

This module covers portions of the following domain on the Security+ exam:

- 3.0 Security Architecture

For more information about these Security+ domains, refer to the following resource: [Security+ Exam Objectives](https://assets.ctfassets.net/82ripq7fjls2/6TYWUym0Nudqa8nGEnegjG/0f9b974d3b1837fe85ab8e6553f4d623/CompTIA-Security-Plus-SY0-701-Exam-Objectives.pdf)

### This Week's Lab Environment

You will use your web lab for this module's activities.

- Use the following credentials to re-access the machine in case you are locked out:

    - Username: `sysadmin`

    - Password: `cybersecurity`

### Preview This Week's Challenge

For this week's Challenge assignment, you will use your new command-line skills to uncover the identities of a rogue casino player and dealer colluding to scam a casino out of thousands of dollars.

### Looking Forward

Next week, we will start thinking like system administrators. We will learn about the Linux operating system and build on the commands and skills that we learned in Module 3 in order to investigate and troubleshoot a malfunctioning server.
