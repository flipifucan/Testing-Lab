# Module 4 Challenge

## Module 4 Challenge <assignment>

### Linux Systems Administration

In this module's class activities, you acted as a system administrator in order to troubleshoot a malfunctioning Linux server.

The senior administrator was quite pleased with your work. Now, they would like you to prepare another server to replace the malfunctioning server. To do so, complete the steps detailed in the Instructions section.

### Lab Environment

You will continue to use your web lab this week.

### Instructions

For each of the following steps, you will need to run the correct command and confirm the results. Take notes of those results as you will be using it for the quiz. 

IMPORTANT: Please review your answers carefully before submitting to ensure that they are free of spelling and spacing errors. Incorrect spelling or incorrect spacing syntax will be marked as incorrect answers.

#### Step 1: Ensure Permissions on Sensitive Files

The `/etc/` directory is where system configuration files exist. Start by navigating to this directory with `cd /etc/`.

Inspect the file permissions of each of the following files. You should have already done this during an in-class activity, but double check them now. If any file's permissions do not match the descriptions listed here, update the file's permissions.

  1. Permissions on `/etc/shadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

  2. Permissions on `/etc/gshadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

  3. Permissions on `/etc/group` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

  4. Permissions on `/etc/passwd` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

> **Hint:** Run the following command to view the file permissions: `ls -l <file>`.
>
> If permissions need changing or modifying, use the `chmod` command.


#### Step 2: Create User Accounts

In this step, you'll set up various users in the system. For this exercise, use the `useradd` command. Research this command to determine how to best use this tool to create the user accounts. The necessary commands do not require that you work from a specific directory.

1. Add user accounts for `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, `sara`, and `admin1`.

    > **Hint:** In order to add users to the system, you need to run the command with `sudo`.

2. Make sure that only the `admin1` user has general `sudo` group access. This requires a command that will allow user modifications.

#### Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder

Now, you'll run the commands to fully set up a group on your system.

This requires you to create a group, add users to it, create a shared group folder, and set the group folder owners for this shared folder.

1. Add the group `engineers` to the system.

2. Add users `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, and `sara` to the managed group. The process is similar to the one you used to add `admin1` to the `sudo` group in the previous step.

3. Create a shared folder for this group: `/home/engineers`.

4. Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the `engineers` group.


#### Step 4: Lynis Auditing

The final step on your administrator's list involves running an audit against the system in order to harden it. You'll use the system and security auditing tool Lynis to do so.

1. Install the Lynis package to your system if it is not already installed.

2. Check the Lynis documentation for instructions on how to run a system audit.

3. Run a Lynis system audit with `sudo`.

4. Provide a report from the Lynis output with recommendations for how to harden the system.


#### Optional Additional Challenge 

Despite claims from enthusiasts, Linux is _not_ immune to malware. In this step, you'll install and run the application chkrootkit to search for any potential rootkits installed on the system.

1. Install the chkrootkit package to your system if it is not already installed.

2. Check the chkrootkit documentation for instructions on how to run a scan to find system rootkits.

3. Run chkrootkit (with `sudo`) in expert mode to verify that the system does not have a rootkit installed.

4. Provide a report from chkrootkit output with recommendations for how to harden the system.
