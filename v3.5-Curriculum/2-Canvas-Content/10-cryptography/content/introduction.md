# Introduction to Module 10

## Introduction to Module 10

### Cryptography

In this module, you'll learn about **cryptography**&mdash;the art and science of keeping information secure by using mathematical concepts and techniques.

  - On Day 1, we will cover the history of cryptography, the difference between encryption and encoding, and how to use a tool called Open SSL to encrypt and decrypt a message.

  - Day 2 will continue the topic of encryption, exploring how asymmetric encryption can address the challenges of symmetric encryption. We will also learn important cryptographic concepts such as hashing and digital signatures. 

  - On Day 3, we will explore how the cryptographic concepts we've learned throughout the week apply to modern technology. We will cover topics such as steganography, SSL certificates, and cracking hashes with Hashcat.

### What to Be Aware Of

On Day 3, during the Steganography activity, be sure to download the steganography image directly from your VM. Slacking the image after downloading it can corrupt the file and cause issues with the activity.

### Security+ Domains

- 1.0 General Security Concepts 

- 3.0 Security Architecture 


For more information about these Security+ domains, refer to the following resource: [Security+ Exam Objectives](https://assets.ctfassets.net/82ripq7fjls2/6TYWUym0Nudqa8nGEnegjG/0f9b974d3b1837fe85ab8e6553f4d623/CompTIA-Security-Plus-SY0-701-Exam-Objectives.pdf)

### This Week’s Lab Environment

You will continue to use your Web Lab virtual machine for today's activities. 


**Next Week's Lab Environment**: At the end of Lesson 10.3, we will set up a new Azure Lab Environment for the NetSec module. 

### Preview This Week’s Challenge

This week's Challenge assignment will reinforce the topics covered during the week. Ransomware has spread throughout a hospital, encrypting all patient records. To decrypt the records, you'll have to solve six cryptographic riddles!

### Looking Forward

Next week, we will move on to network security. We'll cover the ways a network can be attacked and the methods and tools that network professionals use to protect against such attacks.
