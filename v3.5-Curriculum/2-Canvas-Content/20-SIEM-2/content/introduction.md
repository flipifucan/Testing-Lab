## Introduction to Module 20

### SIEM 2

In the second of the SIEM modules, we'll continue learning about the many features and functions Splunk provides to security professionals.

The week will include:

- On Day 1, we'll build on the topics covered in the preceding module, creating visualizations and dashboards to better understand an organization's security posture.
- On Day 2, we'll explore the advanced security monitoring products that security professionals use.
   - We'll also introduce the various certifications that Splunk offers and career paths that use the skills we learn in these two modules. You'll start your first Splunk certification: Splunk Fundamentals 1.
   - Day 2 will conclude with an introduction to the two remaining course projects.

### What to Be Aware Of

The Splunk certification activity on Day 2 requires signing up for Splunk's Fundamentals 1 certification training. It may take 5&ndash;10 minutes to get access to the training module after successfully registering. If the training doesn't start after registration, wait up to 10 minutes and try starting the training module again.
