# Introduction to Module 16

## Introduction to Module 16

### Pen Testing 1

In this module, we'll begin our exploration of **penetration testing**, or **pen testing**&mdash;the offensive security practice of attacking a network using the same techniques that a malicious hacker would use in an effort to identify security holes and raise awareness within an organization. Pen testing is a specific professional role that partners with organizations to assess their security postures, vulnerabilities, and susceptibility to attacks.

A pen testing engagement typically follows a five-phase methodology. Across this module's activities, you'll play the role of a consultant at GoodCorp who's been hired to conduct a penetration test against the fictional company MegaCorpOne. Over the course of the module, you'll move through each of the five phases of a pen test.

### What to Be Aware Of

* :warning: The techniques that we will learn in this module can be used to break into networks and do serious damage to an organization's infrastructure. This is illegal when done without permission. The tools and techniques that we'll discuss in this module are serious, and misusing them can have serious consequences. You should never practice these techniques against computers that you do not own or do not have clear written permission to interact with.

* You'll continue your penetration test against MegaCorpOne in Module 17's activities. You'll conclude your two-module penetration test against MegaCorpOne with a report of your findings, so make sure to keep all of your findings as you proceed through each penetration testing activity.

### Security+ Domains

This module covers portions of the following domains on the Security+ exam:

- 1.0 General Security Concepts 
- 2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations
- 3.0 Security Architecture

For more information about these Security+ domains, refer to the following resource: [Security+ Exam Objectives](https://assets.ctfassets.net/82ripq7fjls2/6TYWUym0Nudqa8nGEnegjG/0f9b974d3b1837fe85ab8e6553f4d623/CompTIA-Security-Plus-SY0-701-Exam-Objectives.pdf).

### This Week’s Lab Environment

For this module, you will use the pen testing lab environment located in Windows Azure Lab Services. RDP into the Windows RDP Host machine using the following credentials:

  - Username: `azadmin`
  - Password: `p@ssw0rdp@ssw0rd`

### Preview This Week’s Challenge

There is no additional Challenge assignment for this module. At the end of Module 17, you'll submit a report detailing your findings from your penetration testing activities against MegaCorpOne, so make sure to keep records of all your findings this week!

### Looking Forward

In this module, we'll explore penetration testing specifically against Linux machines and systems. In the next module, Pen Testing 2, we'll explore pen testing against Windows machines and systems.
