## Lesson 2: Introduction to cron and Scheduled Jobs 
 
### Overview

In today's class, you'll learn how to use `cron` to schedule and automate important maintenance and security tasks such as moving files, updating packages, and running security scans. 
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
- Schedule regular jobs for individual users with crontab.

- Write simple scripts for maintenance and security tasks.

- Use `cron` to automate the execution of security scripts to perform maintenance on a regular basis.

### Today’s Activities

* **Simple Cronjobs:** In this activity, you'll use `cron` to automate jobs in order to perform regularly scheduled backups of files that contain Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and Personal Health Information (PHI).

* **Introduction to Scripts:** In this activity, you'll write scripts that use `cron` to automate various tasks, such as performing regular backups and scheduling regular software updates that help keep a system secure.

* **Scheduling Backups, Cleanups, and Security Checks:** In this activity, you'll add previously written shell scripts to system-wide cronjobs, allowing the scripts to become automated with root privileges. Then, you'll set up regular security scans with Lynis.

* **Reviewing `cron`:** In this activity, you'll review everything you've learned in this class, including `cron`, `tar`, and scripts.
