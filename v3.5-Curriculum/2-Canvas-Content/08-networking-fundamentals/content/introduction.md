# Introduction to Module 8

## Introduction to Module 8

### Networking Fundamentals

In this module, we will focus on one of the most important foundational topics in cybersecurity: computer networking. Understanding how systems and devices are networked together to exchange information is a vital skill for cybersecurity professionals.

  - The first day of this module will cover the client&ndash;server model and network topologies, and how IP addresses and DNS connect systems.

  - The second day will cover additional foundational topics such as ports, protocols, and the OSI model. We will then use a networking tool called Wireshark to visualize and analyze networking concepts.
  
  - The third day will dive deeper into OSI layers 2, 3, and 4. We will learn tools and protocols related to each layer and perform a SYN scan to search for open ports on a network.

### What to Be Aware Of

- On Day 1, during the Network Devices activity, you will use a web-based tool called draw.io to design a network. 

- On Day 2, we will cover the OSI model. It can be a difficult concept to grasp the first time. Don't be discouraged if you don't immediately understand it. You may need to review the OSI layers a few times before fully understanding them.

### Security+ Domains

This module covers portions of the following domains on the Security+ exam:

- 1.0 General Security Concepts 
- 3.0 Security Architecture 

For more information on these Security+ domains, refer to the following resource: [Security+ exam objectives](https://assets.ctfassets.net/82ripq7fjls2/6TYWUym0Nudqa8nGEnegjG/0f9b974d3b1837fe85ab8e6553f4d623/CompTIA-Security-Plus-SY0-701-Exam-Objectives.pdf)

### This Week's Lab Environment

You will use your Web Lab virtual machine for today's activities. 

  - Username: `sysadmin`
  - Password: `cybersecurity`

### Preview This Week's Challenge

For this week's Challenge, you'll play the role of a network security analyst at RockStar Corporation. RockStar Corp recently built a new office in Hollywood, California. You are tasked with completing a network vulnerability assessment of the office.

You will complete several steps to analyze the Hollywood network and then provide RockStar Corp with a summary of your findings.

RockStar Corp is also concerned that a malicious hacker may have infiltrated its Hollywood office. You will need to determine whether there is anything suspicious in your findings.

### Looking Forward

Next week, we will cover more advanced networking concepts such as DHCP, NAT, routing, wireless technology, DNS records, and email networking. We will wrap up the two weeks of networking with a review, followed by an exciting capture-the-flag networking-based competition.
