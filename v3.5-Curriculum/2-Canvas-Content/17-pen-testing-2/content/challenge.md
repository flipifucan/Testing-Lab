# Module 17 Challenge

## Module 17 Challenge <assignment>

### Penetration Test Report

In this assignment, you will record the activities you undertook in both modules of penetration testing against MegaCorpOne and your results, and you'll create a report to turn in to the CISO of MegaCorpOne. This report will be your Challenge deliverable. 

Remember that the report is a very important part of an engagement, as it tells the story of your findings and how you discovered them. Even if you complete all objectives when performing an assessment, a poor report appears to the customer as though you conducted a poor-quality assessment. 

This report will cover your activities across both penetration testing modules. We recommend that you fill the report out as you work to shorten the time outside class to complete it.

### Setup 

- To help you document your findings, you may use the provided [report template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wDIaTVbfBMQyhqnYpsTeAEPFpNj3eTDTnXDg1l8D1x0/copy).

	- Please **do not** write in this template. Make a copy for yourself and fill out your own copy of the report. 

- You are not required to use this template. However, we encourage you to use it or a similar format, because it includes all of the necessary sections and information for a robust report. Even if you do not use this template, you should create your report in a Google Doc.

### Understanding the Report Template
 
#### Introduction, Methodology, Contact Info, and Scope

Following the template format, fill any areas highlighted in yellow. 

- While the client name should remain "MegaCorpOne," you can make up your own penetration testing firm name. 

- Several paragraphs can remain unchanged&mdash;these are commonly referred to as **boilerplate** content, i.e., content that uses standard language without client-specific details. 

- In the "Contact Information" section, you do not have to fill in your real personal data, but the data you provide should be realistic (however, do use your real name). 

- The scope should remain unchanged unless your instructor tells you otherwise.

#### Executive Summary of Findings

An **executive summary** is a project summary that a less-technical executive (e.g., CEO, CISO, or CTO) can read in order to understand the path and outcome of the assessment. Once you reach the "Executive Summary of Findings" section, complete the highlighted areas by documenting the strengths and weaknesses you found during your assessment. Remember to keep this section professional and avoid using overtly negative phrases such as "MegaCorpOne's network security was terrible."

The executive summary should not include details of every action you performed during the assessment, but should include a high-level overview of the steps you took.

#### Summary Vulnerability Overview and Vulnerability Findings

In these sections, you should include detailed information on the vulnerabilities you discovered, including screenshots. The "Vulnerability Findings" section is meant for more detail-oriented system administrators or vulnerability management personnel&mdash;people who can fully understand the vulnerabilities and develop remediation plans based on the content.

#### MITRE ATT&CK Navigator

As we've moved through the penetration testing modules, we've constantly discussed attributing techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) to MITRE ATT&CK. In this section, provide a graph that highlights which TTPs you performed and whether they were successful. Someone reading the report should be able to understand this information at a glance.

Using the [MITRE ATT&CK Navigator](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/), create a map showing what techniques you used. To do so, on the MITRE ATT&CK Navigator page, click "Create New Layer," then "Enterprise," and select each technique you used. Change the color of each selected technique to highlight it in yellow if it was successful or in red if it was unsuccessful. The report template shows an example.

### Submission Guidelines
