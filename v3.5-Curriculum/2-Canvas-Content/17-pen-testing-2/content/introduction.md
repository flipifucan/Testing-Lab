# Introduction to Module 17

## Introduction to Module 17

### Pen Testing 2

In this second penetration testing module, you will continue your penetration testing engagement against MegaCorpOne but shift your focus to testing Windows operating systems.

### What to Be Aware Of

* :warning: The techniques that we will learn in this module can be used to break into networks and do serious damage to an organization's infrastructure. This is illegal when done without permission. The tools and techniques that we'll discuss in this module are serious, and misusing them can have serious consequences. You should never practice these techniques against computers that you do not own or do not have clear written permission to interact with.

* You'll conclude your penetration test against MegaCorpOne with a report of your findings, so make sure to keep all your findings as you proceed through each penetration testing activity.

### Preview This Week's Challenge

For this week's Challenge, you will record the activities that you undertake in your penetration test against MegaCorpOne and your results, and create a report that you'll turn in as a deliverable. This report should cover the activities you conducted in both penetration testing modules. You may use the provided [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wDIaTVbfBMQyhqnYpsTeAEPFpNj3eTDTnXDg1l8D1x0/edit?usp=sharing) for your report, and we recommend filling it out as you work to shorten time outside class to complete it.

### Looking Forward

Next week, we will conclude the Offensive Security unit with a penetration testing project.
