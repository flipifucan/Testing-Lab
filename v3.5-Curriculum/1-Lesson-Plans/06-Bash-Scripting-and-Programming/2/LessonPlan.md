## 6.2 Lesson Plan: Ifs and Lists (Bash Scripting Continued)

### Lesson Overview

Today's class will expand on our bash scripting skills to collect logs, audit, and reconfigure a Linux machine, and take steps to harden the system.

### Lesson Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

- Read bash and interpret scripts;

- Use variables in their bash scripts;

- Use `if` statements in their bash scripts;

- Use lists in their bash scripts; and

- Iterate through lists with a `for` loop to do useful things like install a list of packages.

### Instructor Notes

- This lesson will be the second and final class about bash scripting. The lessons have been configured in a way that should allow non-technical students to get a basic grasp of scripts and reading them, such that they don't get intimidated by the syntax of if statements and `for` loops.

- For the more technically inclined students, they should be able to increase their skills considerably and have two complete, useful scripts by the end of today's class.

### Lab Environment

- You will use your web lab for today's activities. Please note that instructors and students have different access credentials.

  - Instructor access:

    - Username: `instructor`

### 01. Instructor Do: If Statements and Exit (0:25)

Welcome students to class and overview of today's topic. We are on the second day of bash scripting and today we will work on making our scripts a bit more sophisticated. By the end of today, students will have two bash scripts that they will be able to use on their own machines in the future.

Remind class that scripting plays an important role in many cybersecurity roles:

- Sysadmins use them to setup and configure machines.

- Forensic investigators use them for investigations.

- Pentesters use them to probe networks and find vulnerabilities.

These and other tasks require advanced bash skills. Today, we'll continue to develop our scripting skills in order to incorporate the following into our script:

- `if` statements and the flow control based on criteria.

- `for` loops to complete repetitive tasks.

- To automate the set up of a machine.

Explain that these programming concepts apply to most other languages and can help cyber professionals with a general understanding of what a script is doing.

#### Criteria and Decision-Making

First, we will need our scripts to make decisions based on specific criteria.

  - For example, our scripts can check for the existence of users, directories, files, or permissions. Based on these results, the script can then take specific action(s) or even stop execution.

In order to accomplish this feature, we will need to learn a few useful scripting techniques:

- Using `if` statements

- Using `if/else` statements

- Comparing multiple conditions using `if/else` statements

Explain that `if` is used in our scripts as part of a **conditional** statement. Based on a specific condition (or criteria), the script will take a certain action.

- _If this command runs, then exit the script_.

- _If this file exists, then run that command_.

Explain that we will give a quick overview of each technique and then provide a few specific demonstrations.

- In this demo, we will also encounter **comments** and the `exit` command, which we will cover.

#### `if` Demonstration

Start with comments and show the following slide:

```bash
# this is a comment
```

- Explain that a **comment** is a non-executable line of text within the script.

- These comments can help the developers remember what their script is supposed to do when they read it later.

- Commenting is best practice and should be regularly used to explain what the script is doing.

Explain that to create a comment, we place a `#` in front of any line we want to be a comment. Once `#` is placed in front of the line, bash will ignore this line.

- When lines are ignored by bash because of comment symbols, we say those lines are **commented out**.

Now, move onto `if` statement syntax.

Show the following slide:

  ```bash
if [ <condition> ]
then
  <run_this_command>
fi
  ```

Break down the syntax:

- `if`: This initiates our if statement.

- `[]`: This encapsulates the condition.

- `then`: This runs following commands _if_ the condition is met.

- `fi`: This ends the if statement.

Show the following slide:

```
 if [ 5 -gt 8 ]
 then
    echo "That doesn't make sense!"
 fi
```

Break down the syntax:
- `if [ 5 -gt 8 ]`: This will check to see if 5 is greater than 8.
- `then`: This runs the following commands _if_ the condition is met.
- `echo "That doesn't make sense"`/; This will have the script print to the screen "That doesn't make sense."
- `fi`: This ends the if statement.

Point out that the script is looking for a response that is over 8. Because our response is under 8, the script will return a message saying "That doesn't make sense."

#### `if` / `else`

Explain that sometimes if the condition is not met, we want the script to do something else.

- For these scripts, we can use `else`.

Show the following slide:

```bash
if [ <test> ]
then
  <run_this_command>
else
  <run_this_command>
fi
```

Break down the syntax:
- `if [ <test> ]`: if this test is true...

- `then`: run the following command(s)

- `else`: if `[ <test> ]` is false, then run the following command(s)

- `fi`: ends the if statement

Show the following slide:

```
if [ 5 -gt 4 ]
then
    echo "That is correct!"
else
    echo "That doesn't make sense!"
 fi
```

Break down the syntax:

- `if [ 5 -gt 4 ]`: This will check to see if 5 is greater than 4.

- `then`: This will run the following commands _if_ the condition is true.

- `echo "That makes sense"`: This will have the script print to the screen "That makes sense."

- `else`: This will run the following commands _if_ the condition is **false**.

- `echo "That doesn't make sense!"`: If five were less then four, then the script would print "That doesn't make sense."

- `fi`: This will end the if statement.

#### Combining Conditions with `&&` and `||`

Explain that we can check for multiple conditions using the `&&` (and) and `||` (or) operators.

 **Pause for a knowledge check**

- :question: Pose the following question to the class: 

  - "Does anyone remember how a string of commands seperated by `;` or `&&` is affected?" 

    > Answer: Recall that `;` will run each command back-to-back, no matter the outcome of the commands. Therefore, using a `;` to chain commands together may not always give you the correct outcome.

- In other words, _if_ the first command completes, then the system sees that as a 'true' and then moves onto the second command.

For this next example, both `[conditions]` have to be true in order for the following commands to run.

Show this slide:

```bash
if [ <test1> ] && [ <test2> ]
then
   <run_this_command>
fi
```

Show the following slide:

```
 if [ 5 -gt 4 ] && [ 4 -gt 3 ]
 then
    echo "That makes sense."
 else
    echo "That doesn't make sense."
 fi
```

Break down the syntax.

- `if [ 5 -gt 4 ]`: This will check to see if the first condition is true.

- `&&`: This tells the script, if the first condition is true **and** the second condition is true, run the next line of the script.

- `then`: This will run the following command(s) _if_ both conditions are true.

- `echo "That makes sense."`: This will have the script print to the screen "That makes sense."

- `else`: This will run the following commands _if_ the condition is **false**.

- `echo "That doesn't make sense."`:  This will have the script print to the screen "That doesn't make sense."

- `fi`: This will end the if statement.

Explain that if only one of the two (or more) conditions need to be met, then we can use the OR condition, indicated by the `||` symbol.

For this example, only [test1] or [test2] needs to be true.

Show the following slide:

```bash
if [ <test1> ] || [ <test2> ]
then
  <run_this_command>
else  
  <run_this_command>
fi
```

Break down the syntax:

- `if [ <test1> ]`: If this condition is true...

- `|| [ <test2> ]`: ...or this condition is true...

- `then`: then run the following command(s)

- `else`: otherwise (if both conditions are false), run the following command

- `fi`: ends the if statement

Show the following slide:

```
 if [ 5 -gt 4 ] || [ 4 -gt 3 ]
 then
    echo "That kinda makes sense."
 else
    echo "None of this makes sense."
 fi
```

Break down the syntax:

- `if [ 5 -gt 4 ]`: If this condition is true...

- `|| [ 4 -gt 3 ]`: ...or this condition is true...

- `then`: then run the following commands

- `else`: otherwise (if both conditions are false), run the following command

- `fi`: ends the if statement

Move on to the next examples.

#### Creating Conditions

Explain that we will now cover how to design the conditions that are ruled `true` or `false`. If the condition is true, the commands run. If the condition is false, the commands do not run.

Explain that we will compare these values using the following bash conditional expressions:

Show the following slide:

- `=` : This checks if two items are `equal`.

- `!=` : This checks if two items are `not equal`.

- `-d /path_to/directory` : This checks for existence of a directory.

- `-f /path_to/file` : This checks for existence of a file.

#### Equals To and Not Equals To

First we will cover `=`, `equals to`.

Show the following slide:

```bash
# If $x is equal to $y, run the echo command.
if [ $x = $y ]
then
  echo "X is equal to Y!"
fi
```

Break down the syntax:

- `if [ $x = $y ]`: If 5 is equal to 100...

- `then`: then, run the following command

- `echo "X is equal to Y!"`: the echo command that will run if the initial condition is met

- `fi` ends the `if` statement

Point out that this conditional can actually be run as `[ 5 = 100 ]`, we are using variables here for the example.

Explain that if we wanted this test to return true, we can change `=` to `!=`, which stands for 'not equal to.'

Show the following slide:

Type:

```bash
# If x is not equal to y, exit the script
if [ $x != $y ]
then
  echo "$x does not equal $y"
fi
```
Break down the syntax:

- `if [ $x != $y ]`: If 5 is not equal to 100...

- `then`: then run the following commands

- `echo 5 does not equal 100`: the command that is run

- `fi`: ends the `if` statement

Explain that we also can use `=` and `!=` to compare strings.

- In this example, we will use the **`exit` command** to stop the script if the test is true.

- `exit` will stop the script at the point at which it is placed in the script.

- `exit` is commonly used to halt execution based on a condition.

Show the following slide:

```bash
# If "str1" is not equal to "str2", run the echo command and exit the script.
if [ "$str1" != "$str2" ]
then
  echo "These strings do not match."
  echo "Exiting this script."
fi
```

Break down the syntax:

- `if [ $str1 != $str2 ]`: if `$str1` is not equal to `$str2`...

- `then`: then run the following command(s)

- `echo "These strings do not match.`

- `echo "Exiting this script."` 

- `exit`: stop running this script if the condition is true (which it is)

- `fi`: closes out the `if` statement

#### Greater Than and Less Than

Next we will cover the `-gt` (greater than) and `-lt` (less than) conditions.

In this example, if `x` is greater than `y`, then we will run an echo script.

Show the following slide:

```bash
# If x is greater than y, run the echo command
if [ $x -gt $y ]
then
  echo "$x is greater than $y".
fi
```

Break down the syntax:

- `if [ $x -gt $y ]`: if `x` is greater than `y`

- `then`: then, run the echo command

-  `echo "$x is greater than $y":` 

Show the following slide:

```bash
#check if x is less than y
if [ $x -lt $y ]
then
  echo "$x is less than $y!"
else
  echo "$x is not less than $y!"
fi
```

Break down the syntax:

- `if [ $x -lt $y ]`: if `$x` is less than `$y`...

- `then`: then run the following command

- `echo "$x is less than $y!"`: run this echo command if the condition is true

- `else`: otherwise, run the following command

- `echo "$x is not less than $y!"`: run this echo command if the condition is false

Point out that in this example, if `x` is less than `y`, an echo command will run. If the condition is false, the `else` code block runs a different echo command.

 **Pause for a knowledge check**

- :question: Pose the following question to the class: 

  - "What's the difference between an `if` and an `else` statement?" 

    > Answer: The difference is that if the first `if` is true, then the `else` won't be executed, even if the `else` is also true. The `else` will only execute if the `if` that proceeded it was false.

Pause and ask if the students have any questions.

#### Checking Files and Directories as part of Conditional Statements

Explain that we will now cover how to check for files and directories using the following options:

- `-f` to check for files.

- `-d` to check for directories.

In the following examples, we will check if the following directories and files exist. If they do, then we will run echo commands.

Show the following slide:

```bash
# check for the /etc directory
if [ -d /etc ]
then
  echo The /etc directory exists!
fi
# check for my_cool_folder
if [ ! -d /my_cool_folder ]
then
  echo my_cool_folder is not there!
fi
# check for my_file.txt
if [ -f /my_file.txt ]
then
  echo my_file.txt is there
fi
```

Break down the syntax for each of these:

- `if [ -d /etc ]`:

  - If the `/etc` directory exists, run the following echo command.

- `if [ ! -d /my_cool_folder ]`:

  - If `/my_cool_folder` does not exist, run the following echo command.

- `if [ -f /my_file.txt ]`:

  - If the file `/my_file.txt` exists, then run the following echo command.

Explain that these arguments can be very useful for checking if files and folders exist before you create or remove them.

#### Built-In Variables and Command Expansions

Lastly, explain that we can use built-in variables and command expansions inside our tests.

In the following three examples, we will use these variables and command expansions to verify:

- The current user's username;

- The current user's UID; and

- The username of the user running the current script.

Show the following slide:

```bash
# if the user running this script is not the sysadmin user, and then run an echo command
if [ $USER != 'sysadmin' ]
then
  echo you are not the sysadmin!
  exit
fi
```

Break down the syntax:

- `if [ $USER != 'sysadmin' ]`: If the user running this script is **not** the sysadmin user, then run the following echo command and halt execution.

Show the following slide:

```bash
# if the uid of the user that ran this script does not equal 1000, run the echo command
# we use '-ne' for integer comparison
if [ $UID -ne 1000 ]
then
  echo "Your UID is wrong."
  exit
fi
```

Break down the syntax:

- `if [ $UID -ne 1000 ]`: If the `uid` of the user that ran this script does not equal `1000`, then run the following echo command and halt execution.

Show the following slide:

```bash
# if the sysadmin user is running this script, run the echo command
if [ $(whoami) = 'sysadmin' ]
then
  echo 'you are the sysadmin!'
fi
```

Break down the syntax:

- `if [ $(whoami) = 'sysadmin' ]`: If the sysadmin user is running the current script, then run the following echo command.

Before proceeding to the next task, ask class if there are any questions.

### 02. Student Do: Variables and If Statements (0:20)

Explain the following to the students:

- In the previous class, you created your first bash script, edited $PATH variables to create custom commands, and added aliases to your `~/.bashrc` file.

- Now, we will add variables and conditional `if` statements to our scripts.

`If` statements will improve our scripts by allowing us to:

- Check if a file or directory exists before we create it.

- Check what user has run the script.

- And more...

To complete this activity, you will create variables and if statements that satisfy given requirements and use them in your script.

Send students the following files:

- [Variables and If Statements.md](Activities/03_STU_Var_and_if/Unsolved/Readme.md)

[<- Back to Module Contents](LessonPlan.md#module-day-2-contents)

---

### 03. Instructor Do: Variables and If Statements Review (0:10)

:bar_chart: **Comprehension Check**: Run a class poll to evaluate the class's comprehension and ability to complete this activity. 

This activity had students work with `if` statements and variables, implementing them into their script if possible.

Explain that using these tools will improve scripts, making them more functional and logical.

 Variable and If Statements Solution Guide

Using the following guide to review the solution to the previous activity:

- [Solution Guide](Activities/03_STU_Var_and_if/Solved/Readme.md)

Log into the lab environment with the username `instructor` and password `instructor`.

- Move into `~/Cybersecurity-Lesson-Plans/Linux3-Demos`.

- Open the `sys_info.sh` script from the previous class using `nano`.

- Run `nano sys_info.sh`.


Remind students that the point of this exercise is to get practice using variables and if statements and then incorporate them into the script they've been working on.

For students who found this activity challenging, encourage them to review this exercise at home.

Ask if there are any questions before moving on to lists and loops.

[<- Back to Module Contents](LessonPlan.md#module-day-2-contents)

---

### 04. Instructor Do: Lists and Loops (0:20)

Remind students that throughout the past two days, we have been optimizing our scripts with combined commands and conditional statements.

- Each of these tools simplifies and expedites the day-to-day workload of system administrators.

- In the next section, we will continue to streamline daily practices by incorporating iterative structures known as `for` loops into our script.

Explain that system administrators will often complete the same common tasks repeatedly.

- For example: A system administrator might need to run through all the users on a system and check the last time they reset their passwords.

Rather than repeat this task for each user, we can streamline our script with a `for` loop, to run the same command (checking the last password reset) for each user.

Explain how `for` loops work by covering the following:

- A **`for` loop** allows us to run a block of code multiple times in a row, without having to repeatedly type out that code.

- The code is run against a **list** that holds the items in the code block.

- The `for` loop will run once for each item in the list.

In the example of a system administrator checking the passwords of each user:

- The code to check the last time the passwords were reset would be the block of code.

- The users would be the items in the list.

- If there were 100 users, the `for` loop would run the code 100 times, checking the last password reset for each user.

Explain that this process of repeating code with a new item each time it is run is called **iteration**.

#### Lists and for Loops Demonstration

Explain that in the next walkthrough, we will create a list and use a `for` loop.

- Log into the lab environment with the username `instructor` and password `instructor`.

- Open the terminal.

Explain that before we create a loop, we first need to create a list to use.

Point out that bash has several ways that we can create lists. We are going to cover:

- Manually

- Command Expansion

- Brace Expansion

#### Manually Creating Lists

Explain that we will create a list by simply typing the items inside of a `( )`.

- Type: `(a b c d e)`

- **Note:** If students are used to writing in other languages, emphasize that in bash, there are no `,` in between list items.

Next, we will need to save this list to a variable.

- Run: `my_list=(a b c d e f)`.

Now, we will use echo to access the items in our list using the following syntax:

- `echo ${my_list[0]}`

Explain the syntax:

- `{}`: In bash, we need to surround the list with {}.

- `[0]`: Each item in the list is assigned a number, known as an **index**. The number assignment always starts at 0.

- In order to access the item, we use `[]` with the index inside of it.

Explain that we will also place the `@` inside the brackets in order to access _all_ the items.

Provide some examples:

- Run `echo ${my_list[0]}`.

- Run `echo ${my_list[4]}`.

- Run `echo ${my_list[@]}`.

Your output should be:

```bash
$ echo ${my_list[0]}
a
$ echo ${my_list[4]}
e
$ echo ${my_list[@]}
a b c d e f
```

Provide another example:

- Run `my_list=('mon' 'tues' 'wed' 'thurs' 'fri')`.

- Run `echo ${my_list[0]}`.

- Run `echo ${my_list[4]}`.

- Run `echo ${my_list[@]}`.

Your output should be:

```bash
$ echo ${my_list[0]}
mon
$ echo ${my_list[4]}
fri
$ echo ${my_list[@]}
mon tues wed thurs fri
```

Break down the syntax:

- `$`: This is used to access the variable.

- `{}`: This tells bash that the variable is a list.

- `my_list`: This is the variable for our list.

- `[0]`: This indicated which item in the list we want to access. The items within the bracket beginning at zero moving from left to right in the list.

- `@`: This is used to access all the items.

Lastly, you can create a list from a text file:

- Run `mapfile -t my_list < example.txt`.

Break down the syntax:

- `mapfile`: The program being used.

- `-t`: This removes the trailing characters from each line.

- `my_list`: The name of the list.

- `< example.txt`: This brings in the data one line at a time.


#### Command Expansion

Explain that we can also specify expansions in place of a list.

Point out that we are already familiar with command expansions like `$(ls)`, which will return a list of files.

- Run `echo $(ls)`.

- Your output should be a list of files.

Point out that when we use command expansion, we can't access the items individually using the `[]` syntax, but we will see that we can access them with a loop in a few moments.

Explain that another way to get a list is with `brace` expansion. Brace expansion will give you a list of numbers if you need them.

Run `echo {0..5}`.

Your output should be:

```bash
$ echo {0..5}
0 1 2 3 4 5
```

#### Loops Syntax

In this demonstration, we will incorporate a list into a `for` loop.

First, we'll cover the syntax of a `for` loop.

- Open the script named `ins_for_loops.sh`.

- Run `nano ins_for_loops.sh`.

Output should be:

```bash
# for <item> in <list>;
# do
#   <run_this_command>
#   <run_this_command>
# done
```

Break down the syntax:

- `for` initiates the `for` loop.

- `<item>` is a variable that holds each item in the list one by one as the loop repeats. "item" can be named anything you want. `item` is common. `index` is common or even just `i`.

- `in <list>` represents each item in the list.

- `;` is always used to close the initial statement.

- `do` runs the commands that follow.

- `done` ends our `for` loop.

#### for Loops examples:

Now we we will take a look at a few examples.

First let's make a list:

```bash
# list variables
months=(
    'january'
    'february'
    'march'
    'april'
    'may'
    'june'
    'july'
    'august'
    'september'
    'october'
    'november'
    'december'
)
days=('mon' 'tues' 'wed' 'thur' 'fri' 'sat' 'sun')
```

Explain that if you have a really long list, you can use this syntax where each list item is on its own line.

In the first example, we have a `for` loop that will print out all the months in a year.

```bash
#print out months
for month in ${months[@]};
do
    echo $month
done
```

Break down the syntax:

- `for` starts off our loop.

- `month` is our variable that will hold each string in the list of $months.

- `in ${months[@]}` represents every string in the list of months.

- `;` closes the opening statement.

- `do` runs the commands that follow.

- `echo $month` runs this echo command. Point out that each time the loop runs, the `$month` variable holds the value of the next list item.

- `done` closes out our `for` loop.

 **Pause for a knowledge check**

- :question: Pose the following question to the class: 

  - "Can anyone name three ways we can create lists in Bash?" 

    > Answer: We can create lists in Bash **manually** or by using **Command Expansion**, or by using **Brace Expansion**.

Ask if there are any questions here.

Ask the class if anyone knows what output of the following script will be.

```bash
#print out the days of the week
for day in ${days[@]}
do
    if [ $day = 'sun' ] || [ $day = 'sat' ]
    then
        echo "It is $day. Take it easy."
    else
        echo "It is $day. Get to work!"
    fi
done
```

Make sure to cover the syntax:

- `for day in ${days[@]}` for every item in the list of days.

- `do` runs the commands that follow.

- `if [ $day = 'sun' ] || [ $day = 'sat' ]` _if_ the $day equals "sat" or the $day equals "sun."

- `then` runs the command that follows.

- `echo "It is $day. Take it easy."` runs this echo command.

- `else` _otherwise_ run a different command.

- `echo "It is $day. Get to work!"` runs this command.

- `fi` closes our if statement.

- `done` closes our `for` loop.

Move to the next examples and point out that we can use command expansion or brace expansion directly in place of the list.

```bash
# run a command on each file
for file in $(ls);
do
    ls -lah $file
done
```

Break down the syntax:

- `for file in $(ls);`: First, run the command `ls` to get a list of files. Then, for each item(file) in that list.

- `do`: The command that follows.

- `ls -lah $file`: Run this command. Remind the students that every time the loop comes around, `$file` will represent a different item from the list returned by the `ls` command.

- `done`: This closes out our `for` loop.

Discuss this syntax as needed until there are no further questions.

Ask the class if anyone knows what output of the following script will be.

```bash
# run an operation on each number
for num in {0..5};
do
    if [ $num = 1 ] || [ $num = 4 ]
    then
      echo $num
    fi
done

```

Be sure to cover each part of the syntax:

- `for num in` kicks off our `for` loop with a `num` variable.

- `{0..5}` _expands_ into a list: (0 1 2 3 4 5).

- `do` runs these commands for each item in the list.

- `if [ $num = 1 ] || [ $num = 4 ]` _if_ the number is 1 or the number is 4.

- `then` runs the command(s) that follow.

- `echo $num` runs this command.

- `fi` closes the if statement.

- `done` closes the `for` loop.

Explain that in the next exercise, students will have the opportunity to create some `for` loops for practice.

### 05. Student Do: Lists and Loops (0:20)

Explain the following to students:

- In the previous activity, we added variables to our script and used `if` statements to check various conditions.

- Next, we use loops to automate repetitive tasks.

- To complete this activity, you will create several `for` loops that satisfy given requirements. If you get to the bonus task, you can incorporate a `for` loop into your script.

### 08. Instructor Do: `For` Loops for a System Administrator (0:20)

Explain to the class that we will learn ways to use `for` loops to audit a machine.

Sometimes, writing a script might be overkill for the scale of the task at hand, so we will use these `for` loops directly on the command line instead of in an executable script file.

Show some uses of loops that are extremely valuable to cybersecurity professionals:

- Loop through a list of packages to check if they are installed.

- Loop through the results of a find command and take action on each item found.

- Loop through a list of files, check their permissions, and change if needed.

- Loop through a list of files and create a cryptographic hash of each file.

- Loop through all the users on the system and take an action for each one.

Get started by completing the following set up:

- Log into the lab environment with the username `instructor` and password `instructor`.

- Open a terminal.

- Open the `~/Cybersecurity-Lesson-Plans/Linux3_Demos/useful_loops.sh` file.

- Run `nano useful_loops.sh`.

Inform class that we will start by checking if certain packages are installed.

#### Looping Packages

In this example, we use a `for` loop to iterate through a list of packages and check if each one is installed.

```bash
# Define packages list
packages=(
    'nano'
    'wget'
    'net-tools'
)

# loop though the list of packages and check to see if they are installed
for package in ${packages[@]};
do
    if [ $(which $package) ]
    then
        echo "$package is installed at $(which $package)."
    else
        echo "$package is not installed."
    fi
done
```

Ask for a volunteer to explain what this `for` loop does.

Make sure to cover these syntax items:

-  `for package in ${packages[@]};`: For each package in the list `packages`...

    - In our list the first item: `nano`.

- `if [ $(which $package) ]`: If the command `which package` returns a value...

  - **Note:** When we run a command, it always returns a value, either `0` or `1`. `0` means the command was successful (`TRUE`) and  `1` means it fails (`FALSE`).

- `echo "$package is installed at $(which $package)."`: Run this echo command that states that the package is installed.

- `else`: "Otherwise...:

- `echo "$package is not installed."`: Run this echo command that states that the package is not installed.

Gauge students comprehension and see if they have any questions.

#### Looping through Users

In this example, we will search each user's home directory for scripts and print a confirmation statement.

```bash
# Search each user's home directory for scripts and provide a formatted output.
for user in $(ls /home);
do   
    for item in $(find /home/$user -iname '*.sh');
    do
        echo -e "Found a script in $user's home folder! \n$item"
    done
done
```

 **Pause for a knowledge check**

- :question: Pose the following question to the class: 

  - "Does anyone know what a **nested loop** is?" 

    > Answer: A nested loop is a loop within a loop.

Explain that, in this demo, we use a **nested loop**, a loop within a loop.

- We are looping through two separate lists.

- First, we create a list using `ls /home` to gather the names of each user on the system.

- Then, for each user, we search their home directory for files ending in `.sh`.

- For each file that is found, we print a string that tells us which user's home folder it was found and the full path of the file.

Cover the following syntax:

- `for user in $(ls /home);`: "For the user in the list that is returned by running `ls /home`..."

- `for item in $(find /home/$user -iname '*.sh');`: "For each item found in the user's home folder that ends in `.sh`..."

- `echo -e "Found a script in $user's home folder! \n$item"`: "Run this echo command stating that we found a script."

Point out the use of the `-e` flag and the `\n` line break in the echo command to format the output.

#### Looping Permissions

Move on to the next example:

```bash
# loop through scripts in my scripts folder and change the permissions to execute
for script in $(ls ~/scripts);
do
    if [ ! -x ~/scripts/$script ]
    then
        chmod +x ~/scripts/$script
    fi
done
```

Break down the syntax:

- `for script in $(ls ~/scripts);`: for each file returned by the command `ls ~/scripts`

- `if [ ! -x ~/scripts/$script ]`: "_if not_ executable the file" or if the file is not executable

- `chmod +x ~/scripts/$script`: run this chmod command to make the file executable

Ask if there are any questions about this block or about using `-x`, `-w`, or `-r`.

#### Looping Hashes

In the final example, we will create a `for` loop that iterates over a list of files and creates a hash of each file.

```bash
# loop through a list of files and create a hash of each file.
for file in $(ls ~/Documents/files_for_hashing/);
do
    sha256sum $file
done
```

Cover this syntax:

- `for file in $(ls ~/Documents/files_for_hashing/);`: For each file returned by running this `ls` command.

- `sha256sum $file`: Run this command (create a sha256sum hash).

Explain that a hash is a cryptographic representation of the file that helps ensure file integrity. If the file changes, the hash changes.

- We will cover `check sums` or `hashes` in depth during the cryptography week.

- Let students know that we're using hashes as a real-world example of looping through a list of files and applying a command to them.

Ask if there are any questions about any of these `for` loops.

### 09. Partner Do: Loops for System Administrators (0:25)

**Note**: Students work in pairs for this activity.

Explain the following to students:

- In the previous activity, we created `for` loops. Now, we use those loops to complete tasks that are useful to a system administrator.

In this activity, you will work in pairs to take a look at a few useful loops you can add to your `sys_info.sh` script, as well as loops you can use directly in the command line.

Send the following files to students:

### 11. Instructor Do: Follow Along (Optional if time permits)

If you have extra time in this class, you can continue with the following script:

Remind the students where we are in today's curriculum:

- We started by using _if_ statments to control the execution flow of a script.

- Then we combined `for` loops and `if` statements to carry out potentially valuable tasks of a system administrator.

Explain that for the rest of class, you will walk through a pre-built 'setup' script with the class.

Explain that students can follow along by running `sudo nano ~/Cybersecurity-Lesson-Plans/Linux3_Demo/Final_Script.sh`. 

Point out that at the end of class, students will have two scripts that they can use as a reference in the future.

#### Script Along

Log into the lab environment with the username `instructor` and password `instructor`.

- Open a terminal.

Navigate to `~/Cybersecurity-Lesson-Plans/Linux3_Demo/Final_Script.sh`.

- Run `nano Final_Script.sh`.

- Explain we have `!/bin/bash` at the top of the script as this is a bash script.

Explain that we have a comment of what the script does:

- Highlight: `# Quick setup script for new server.`

Explain that this script will run several commands that will need `sudo` access, so we want to ensure that users run the script using `sudo`.

- Highlight:

  ```bash
  # Make sure the script is run as root.
  if [ ! $UID -ne 0 ]
  then
  echo "Please run this script with sudo."
    exit
  fi
  ```

Point out that this is the same statement we used in the previous exercises.

Explain that we want this script to log its progress. To this end, we will create a log file and a variable that references that log file.

- Type:


  ```bash
  # Create a log file that our script will write to as it completes items
  log_file=/var/log/setup_script.log
  ```

Point out that the `log_file` in this case is our variable. 

Explain that the following code gives our log file a header and a nice format:

- Highlight:

  ```bash
  # Log file header
  echo "Log file for general server setup script." >> $log_file
  echo "############################" >> $log_file
  echo "Log generated on: $(date)" >> $log_file
  echo "############################" >> $log_file
  echo "" >> $log_file
  ```

Pause and ask if there are any questions about this log file creation or using the $log_file variable.

Explain that next we will want our setup script to check the system for certain packages. If those packages aren't there, we will want to install them.

- Highlight:

  ```bash
  # List of packages needed on the System
  packages=(
    'nano'
    'wget'
    'net-tools'
    'python'
    'tripwire'
    'tree'
    'curl'
  )
  ```

Explain that we created a `for` loop that checks for each package and installs it if it isn't there.

- Highlight:

  ```bash
  # Iterate through our package list and ensure that they are all installed.
  for package in ${packages[@]};
  do
    if [ ! $(which $package) ];
    then
      apt install -y $package
    fi
  done
  ```

Break down the syntax:

- `for package in ${packages[@]};`: for each package in our list of packages

- `if [ ! $(which $package) ];`: if the command `which $package` fails

- `apt install -y $package`: runs the command to install the package

Point out the `-y` option for the `apt install` and remind the students that this will answer yes to any questions the installer has for any of these packages.

We don't need to use `sudo` here, because the script will only run if it is run with `sudo` in the first place. So, every command we write will run with `root` privileges.

Explain that after these installations are complete, we want to log them. It would also be nice to print out a message to the screen that tells us what happened.

- The command `tee` does exactly this: it will print the output to the screen and send the output to the file of our choice.

Point out that we want to be sure to use the `-a` option so that `tee` _appends_ to our log file, otherwise it overwrites it:

- Highlight:

```bash
# Print it out and Log it
echo "$(date) Installed needed packages: ${packages[@]}" | tee -a $logfile
```

Explain that, we can also use the script to setup a new user called `ryan` on the system and give them the correct `sudo` permissions:

```bash
# Create a ryan user with no password (password to be created upon login)
useradd ryan
chage -d 0 ryan
```

Remind students that we can use the `usermod` command to add a user to the `sudo` group:

```bash
# Add ryan user to the `sudo` group
usermod -aG sudo ryan
```

Emphasize that we want to log these actions:

```bash
# Print it out and Log it
echo "$(date) Created ryan user. Password to be created upon login" | tee -a $log_file
```

Explain that now we can take some steps to harden the system.

Ask the students if they remember ways to harden the system, such as changing the permissions on sensitive files or disabling the root user.

Take some answers from the class and make sure to cover the following code:

```bash
# Remove roots login shell and lock the root account.
usermod -s /sbin/nologin root
usermod -L root

# Print it out and Log it
echo "$(date) Disabled root shell. Root user cannot login." | tee -a $log_file

# Change permissions on sensitive files
chmod 600 /etc/shadow
chmod 600 /etc/gshadow
chmod 644 /etc/group
chmod 644 /etc/passwd

# Print it out and Log it
echo "$(date) Changed permissions on sensitive /etc files." | tee -a $log_file
```

Point out that it might be nice to setup our `scripts` folder and add it to our path, so we can start making custom commands as needed on the system.

Take some suggestions from the class on how to do this and be sure to cover the following code:

```bash
# Setup scripts folder
if [ ! -d /home/ryan/scripts ]
then
  mkdir /home/ryan/scripts
  chown ryan:ryan /home/ryan/scripts
fi

# Add scripts folder to .bashrc for ryan
echo "" >> /home/ryan/.bashrc
echo "PATH=$PATH:/home/ryan/scripts" >> /home/ryan/.bashrc
echo "" >> /home/ryan/.bashrc

# Print it out and Log it
echo "$(date) Added ~/scripts directory to ryan's PATH." | tee -a $log_file
```

Point out that adding a few custom aliases might be nice too:

```bash
# Add custom aliases to /home/ryan/.bashrc
echo "#Custom Aliases" >> /home/ryan/.bashrc
echo "alias reload='source ~/.bashrc && echo Bash config reloaded'" >> /home/ryan/.bashrc
echo "alias lsa='ls -a'" >> /home/ryan/.bashrc
echo "alias docs='cd ~/Documents'" >> /home/ryan/.bashrc
echo "alias dwn='cd ~/Downloads'" >> /home/ryan/.bashrc
echo "alias etc='cd /etc'" >> /home/ryan/.bashrc
echo "alias rc='nano ~/.bashrc'" >> /home/ryan/.bashrc

# Print it out and Log it
echo "$(date) Added custom alias collection to ryan's bashrc." | tee -a $log_file
```

Explain that we should end our script with a message to let the user know it's finished:

  ```bash
  #Print out and log Exit
  echo "$(date) Script Finished. Exiting."
  echo "$(date) Script Finished. Exiting." >> $log_file

  exit
  ```

Save and quit the script.

- Run `chmod +x Final_Script.sh`.

Explain that this script should be ready to run on any new system.

Answer any questions from the students before dismissing class.
