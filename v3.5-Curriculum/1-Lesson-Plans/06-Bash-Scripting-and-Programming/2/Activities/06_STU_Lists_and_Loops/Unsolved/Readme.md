## Activity File: Lists and Loops

In the previous activity, we added variables to our script.  We also added conditional flow control using `if` statements.

Next, you will use loops to automate repetitive tasks in your script.

Loops facilitate code reuse by allowing commands to be run many times without actually typing them repeatedly.

This adds another layer of sophistication and efficiency to your script.

To complete this activity, you will create several `for` loops that satisfy given requirements. If you get to the bonus, you can incorporate a `for` loop into your script.

### Create your script file

1. Create a new file named `for_loops.sh` and open it in your text editor.

2. Add the required `boiler plate` line at the top so that your computer knows it's a bash script.


### Create a `for` loop

Create a `for` loop that scans a list of IP addresses and a list of ports to check.  Use 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4, and 1.1.1.1 for the IP addresses.  Use ports 80 and 443 for port check.

**Bonus Exercise**

1. During the last exercise, you created a variable that holds the command `find /home -type f -perm 777 2> /dev/null` and then you used `echo` to print out your variable later in the script.

You may have noticed that this produces an output that is a bit jumbled together:

```bash
Exec Files:
/home/sysadmin/Documents/setup_scripts/sysadmin/day3_stu_setup.sh /home/instructor/Documents/setup_scripts/sysadmin/day3_stu_setup.sh /home/instructor/Documents/setup_scripts/instructor/day3_setup.sh
```

#### Challenge

Instead of using `echo` to print out this variable, use a `for` loop to print out each file on it's own line.
