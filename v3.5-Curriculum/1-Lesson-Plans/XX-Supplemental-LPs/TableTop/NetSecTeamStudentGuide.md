### Tabletop Exercise: Network Security Team Student Guide

#### Role Overview

As the Network Security Team for Rekall during Operation Silent Breach, you are tasked with securing the organization's network infrastructure against the current ransomware attack. Your responsibilities include identifying the attack vectors, containing the breach, and preventing further unauthorized access by leveraging network security tools and protocols to protect Rekall's assets.

**Key Responsibilities**

- **Traffic Analysis and Monitoring:** Scrutinize network traffic to pinpoint malicious activities. Utilize intrusion detection systems (IDS) and network monitoring tools to detect anomalies that suggest unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- **Containment and Segmentation:** Apply network segmentation and update firewall rules to isolate compromised segments of the network, halting the spread of ransomware. Implement access control lists (ACLs) to restrict traffic to sensitive areas of the network.
- **Collaboration and Communication:** Work closely with the Endpoint Security Team and IR Team, providing them with critical network insights and data to aid in the overall incident response effort. Ensure effective communication channels are maintained for the swift exchange of information.
- **Recovery and Resilience Enhancement:** Aid in the restoration of network services and fortify network defenses to bolster resilience against future cyber threats. This includes revising network security policies and implementing stronger encryption protocols.

**Initial Information Provided**

As Network Security Administrators tasked with managing the aftermath of Operation Silent Breach at Rekall, you have access to a range of detailed information and data points critical for analyzing the incident. This guide provides a structured overview of the specifics you need to track the attackers' activities within the network, understand the scope of the attack, and formulate an effective containment and eradication strategy.
