### Tabletop Exercise: IR Team Student Guide

#### Role Overview

The Incident Response (IR) Team is the strategic command center for managing the cybersecurity incident. Your primary responsibilities include overseeing the overall response to the ransomware attack, coordinating between different security teams, and ensuring effective communication both internally and externally. Your team acts as the orchestrator of the response efforts, ensuring that actions taken by other teams align with the overarching strategy to mitigate the incident's impact.

**Key Responsibilities**

- **Incident Analysis and Coordination:** Assess the scope and impact of the incident. Coordinate the efforts of the Endpoint Security Team and the Network Security Team to ensure a cohesive and comprehensive response.
- **Communication:** Serve as the primary point of contact for internal and external stakeholders. This includes briefing executive management, liaising with legal and PR teams, and coordinating with law enforcement if necessary.
- **Documentation and Compliance:** Ensure that all actions taken during the incident response are thoroughly documented. Monitor compliance with regulatory requirements and internal policies.
- **Recovery and Post-Incident Review:** Oversee the recovery process, ensuring business-critical functions are restored first. Lead the post-incident review to identify lessons learned and to update the incident response plan accordingly.

**Initial Information**

- Evidence of a phishing campaign targeting high-privileged users
- Indicators of lateral movement within the network
- Reports of ransomware encryption on several critical servers
- Disruption of internal communication tools

Your job is to ask each of the teams questions to answer and develop an eventual timeline of the incident with detailed timestamps. Remember, as part of the IR Team, it's important to also contain the malware from spreading and prevent further attacks, so you should be implementing defensive actions along the way. 

Here are some sample questions to help you get started:

1. **Scope and Impact**
   - What systems, networks, and data have been compromised?
   - What is the extent of the data encryption by the ransomware?
   - Are there any indications of data exfiltration?

2. **Initial Entry**
   - How did the attackers gain initial access to the network?
   - Were there any vulnerabilities exploited, or was this a case of social engineering?
   - Can we identify the phishing email or other methods used for the initial compromise?

3. **Containment Efforts**
   - Have we isolated the affected systems and networks to prevent further spread of the ransomware?
   - Are the containment measures impacting business operations, and if so, how can we minimize this impact?

4. **Eradication and Recovery**
   - What steps are being taken to remove the ransomware and any backdoors the attackers might have installed?
   - What is the plan for restoring encrypted data, and do we have backups available?
   - How are we ensuring that restored systems are not still compromised?

5. **Communication**
   - What information has been shared with employees, clients, and other stakeholders?
   - How are we managing communications to avoid misinformation and panic?
   - Have we notified law enforcement, and are we complying with regulatory reporting requirements?

6. **Post-Incident Analysis**
   - What lessons have we learned from this incident regarding vulnerabilities in our systems or gaps in our security posture?
   - How effective were our incident response plan and our team's response to the incident?
   - What changes or improvements will we make to our security measures and incident response plan based on these lessons?
