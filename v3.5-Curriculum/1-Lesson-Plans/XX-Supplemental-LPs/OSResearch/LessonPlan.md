# 1.1 Lesson Plan: OS Research

### Overview

Today's activity will be a project in which students will research various operating systems and turn in a Google Slideshow as a deliverable.

### Class Objectives

By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:

- Understand basic research skills

- Explain the different between Linux, Mac, and Windows

- Understand what a distribution is and how it differentiates Linux from MacOS and Windows

### Slideshow

The lesson slides are available on Google Drive here: [1.1 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fqxUYKlJ49zm55RrYIVQ0Lt6tbyO47MYTrjfwsswdjc/edit#slide=id.g2c265dbf074_0_1014)

### Lab Environment

Today will not require a lab environment. Instead, students will use their own computer to perform research and use Google Slides to develop a presentation.

### 01. Instructor Do: Welcome and Project Scenario

Inform students that today we will be using a supplemental lesson plan in lieu of our current scheduled lesson plan. In today's class, students will be researching various operating systems. Students should aim to cover a range of topics that give a comprehensive view of each OS (Linux, MacOS/OSx, Windows) highlighting their unique features, uses, and the environments they support. Below is a guideline of topics that can help structure their reports:

- Introduction to Operating Systems
	- Brief overview of what operating systems are and their role in computing
	- Importance of operating systems in managing hardware and software resources

- History and Development
	- Historical development of the operating system being covered
	- Key milestones and versions

- Architecture
	- Overview of the OS architecture (e.g., monolithic, microkernel)
	- Discussion on how the OS manages processes, memory, files, and I/O operations

- User Interface
	- Description of the user interface (UI) types supported (e.g., graphical user interface, command-line interface)
	- Key differences and usability features

- Core Features and Functionality
	- Detailed exploration of key features (e.g., security, networking capabilities, process management)
	- Any unique features that distinguish the OS from others

- Compatibility and Ecosystem
	- Hardware requirements and compatibility
	- Software ecosystem, including availability of applications and development tools
	- Compatibility with other operating systems and virtualization

- Use Cases
	- Typical use cases and domains where the OS is preferred or widely used (e.g., desktop computing, servers, mobile devices, embedded systems)
	- Pros and cons for these use cases

- Security
	- Overview of the security model and features (e.g., user authentication mechanisms, encryption, access controls)
	- Discussion of known vulnerabilities and historical security issues, if applicable

- Community and Support
	- Information on the developer and user community (e.g., open-source community, commercial support)
	- Resources available for learning and troubleshooting (e.g., official documentation, forums, tutorials)

- Future Directions
	- Recent updates and future plans for the OS
	- Trends and technologies that may affect its development and adoption

- Personal Insights and Critical Analysis
	- Critical analysis of the OS’s strengths and weaknesses in comparison to others

- Conclusion
	- Summary of key findings
	- Reflection on the importance of the OS in the broader context of computing and technology

Encouraging students to include charts, comparisons, screenshots, or even short video demonstrations can make the report more engaging and provide a clearer understanding of the operating systems being discussed. It is not expected for students to present their reports if they do not wish to do so.
