## Activity File: Stored XSS

- In this activity, you will review the Google Gruyere web site for any stored XSS vulnerabilities.

- Search every available web page for input boxes and attempt to submit a XSS payload. 

- An available cheatsheet for XSS payloads can be found at [this link](https://github.com/payloadbox/xss-payload-list)

### Setup

You will be using Google Gruyere for this activity. Google Gruyere is a purposely vulnerable website used to teach web application penetration testing. 

- To start your own Google Gruyere session, go to https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/start 

- You should be redirected to a page that has a long number in the URL, e.g.: https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/504196611931487757336424032094481296790

### Instructions 

1. In your Google Gruyere instance, look through the available web pages and find where you can input data. Hint: You may need to create an account!

2. After submitting your XSS payload to the input box, refresh the page. If your payload executes upon refreshing, then your stored XSS attack worked.
