## Activity File: Directory Traversal

- In this activity, you will review the Google Gruyere web site for any directory traversal vulnerabilities.

### Setup

You will be using Google Gruyere for this activity. Google Gruyere is a purposely vulnerable website used to teach web application penetration testing. 

- To start your own Google Gruyere session, go to https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/start. 

- You should be redirected to a page that has a long number in the URL, e.g., https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/504196611931487757336424032094481296790.

### Instructions 

1. In your Google Gruyere instance, attempt to view the file 'secret.txt' **without** going to /code. 

2. This will require a directory traversal exploit; however, modern browsers will automatically fix URLs that contain "unnecessary" slashes (/). Instead of using "../", we must use "..%2f", which is the URL encoded version of "../".
