## Activity File: Offensive Security and Machine Learning

For this activity, you will be using **WormGPT** to see how ML can help security professionals design targeted phishing campaigns.
- **Important:** Note the ethicality of ML tools like WormGPT. As they can be powerful and dangerous if used maliciously.
  - Like the many offensive activities we do in this class, using these tools to create and practice social engineering campaigns, can be considered illegal if not done without prior documented approval.
  - **ONLY** conduct this activity against the mock organization (Megacorpone) and the mock website provided (https://www.megacorpone.com/), as this ficticious organization and website is used to safely practice offensive security.

### Background
