## Activity File: Neural Networks

This activity uses a demo made by the [Teachable Machine project from Google](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/v1/) to show how ML works.

### Instructions

Complete the following steps:

* Open your web browser and navigate to [the Teachable Machine website](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/v1/). This web application shows the fundamental mechanism of a neural network by training a model that recognizes gestures from your webcam to predict one of three classes.

Once you open the Teachable Machine website, follow the next steps to conduct the demo:

* Click the “skip the tutorial” option to start the demo.

* Allow the web application to use your webcam and microphone.

Now you are going to train the neural network model by doing the following:

1. Raise your left hand and press the TRAIN GREEN button for a few seconds. Your current image is the input data for the neural network. It's learning that these visual patterns correspond to a cute kitten.

2. Continue to train the purple class by posing seriously for the camera. Press the TRAIN PURPLE button for a few seconds. Now the neural network is learning that your poker face corresponds to a furry dog.

3. Finally, train the orange class by making a funny face and pressing the TRAIN ORANGE button for a few seconds. You are telling the neural network that this funny pose corresponds to a little bunny.

Now that you have trained the model, play around by making several poses and faces for the camera:

* Raise your right hand. Although the neural network was trained to recognize your left hand raised, these kinds of models are continuously learning and capable of recognizing and learning new patterns.

* Make a tricky test by partially raising your left hand. The neural network gets confused but is still learning, as can be seen on the confidence bars; finally, the model can decide on your partially raised hand.
