## Activity File: Email Export
 
In this activity, you'll continue in the role of digital forensic investigator.

- Your task is to export the email database for offline examination.
 
- You and the investigative team will use this offline email file to find additional incriminating evidence in an upcoming activity.

### Instructions
 
1. Open your case file in Autopsy:
 
   - Start the Kali VM and open a terminal.

   - Navigate to: `/root/autopsy-files/autopsy-4.10.0/bin`

   - Run `./autopsy` to launch Autopsy.

   - Open the recent case:
      - Case name: `Pure-Gold-Credit-Union`
      - Case number: `1EZ215-P`
 
2. A senior investigative team member has asked you to export the `Mail` folder for offline analysis:

    - Locate the `Mail` folder from the directory tree.
        - Note that extracting a directory uses the same method as extracting a single file.

    - Extract the directory to the `Export` directory located at `/root/casedata/Pure_Gold_Credit_Union/Export`.
 
3. Verify the export:
 
   - Open a new terminal window.
 
   - Navigate to the `Exports` directory and `cd` into the `Message Data` directory.
 
   - Run `ls -l`. Take note of the multiple directories present.
 
   - `cd` into any of the directories and take note of the EMLX files.
