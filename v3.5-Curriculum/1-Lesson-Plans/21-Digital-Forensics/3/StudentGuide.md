### 01. Welcome and Overview 

Welcome to the third day of the digital forensics module. Here is what we covered in the last class:

- Identifying methods used in smartphone forensics.
- Examining databases and file structures of an iPhone directory image.
- Locating and documenting evidence of ownership for an iPhone image.
- Using Autopsy to view and tag evidence of an iPhone image.
- Extracting data for use in other applications (logs, text, pictures, video, audio).

Note the following:

- As a forensic investigator, it's critical that you understand how to use tools such as Autopsy, and how to export data so other team members can perform offline analysis of evidence.

- .emlx is a file extension called Mail Message thatâ€™s used to store email messages.

- EMLX files are often referred to as Apple Mail files because they are created with Apple's mail program to store plain text files for a single message.

### 02.  Activity: Email Export

- In this activity, you will continue your role as a digital forensics investigator.

- Your task is to export the email database for offline analysis using examination tools outside of Autopsy.

- [Activity File: Email Export](Activities/02_Email_Export/Unsolved/README.md)

### 03. Activity Review: Email Export

Note the following concepts:

- File exports enable database information to be easily transferred to spreadsheets or Word documents, where it can be integrated into reports and analyzed by other teams.

Completing this activity requires the following steps:

- Search the directory tree to find Peter's email files.
- Perform a directory export for Peter's emails.
- Verify the export to see if the EMLX files were successfully created in the `Export` directory.

### 04. Peter's Email Evidence

We already exported Peter's emails to the `Export` directory during the warm-up activity.

Now you will use offline analysis to uncover details about the plot of the crime and possibly identify the co-conspirators and their roles.

#### Importance of Emails

You can extract critical information from emails, such as:

- Sender's email address
- Sender's IP address
- Internet Service Provider
- User client (email app)
- Location information

All of this information plays an important role in conducting a digital forensics investigation.

#### Examine Emails in Kali Linux

You will demonstrate how to display email messages in the `Mail/MessageData` folder.

- These emails were exported to the `Mail/MessageData` folder in Kali Linux during the warm-up activity.
    - *Note: There may be a small variation in the name of your "mail" folder.*

Open a terminal window and navigate into the directory that contains the `MessageData` directory.  

- Run `ls -l` to see the full contents of the `Messages` folder.

Each of these directories contain EMLX files.

   ![An image showing EMLX files in the directory.](Images/forensics_day3_1.png)

#### Search for items of interest

In the next activity, you will continue your investigation by using preview commands to view the contents of each EMLX file, as shown below.

   ![An image showing the contents of an EMLX file.](Images/forensics_day3_2.png)
  - You will also look at any email attachments and tag items of interest in Autopsy.

The following diagram provides a high-level overview of the threat actor's involvement in the PGCU case.

  - You should use this as a roadmap to tie Peter's associates to each incident.

     ![An image showing the threat actors involved in the PGCU case.](Images/forensics_day3_3.png)

 Review the following worksheet:

-  The [Correspondence Evidence Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zS-QDGYhMnbZZrwcapIrwdn73fUoh3MSkaZCcX-7LUM/edit?usp=sharing) is used to document evidence from the communications (i.e., phone calls, emails, text messages) found on Peter's phone. Students should complete this as a group.

  - You will fill out the following information:

      - Artifact numbers to help organize records
      - Timestamp (time email was sent or received)  
      - Header information
        - These should include names of the individuals involved, their email addresses, and the email subject line.
      - Key information
        - Summary of the email contents.
      - Evidence location
        - Source of the data (For example, email, SMS, phone call, etc.)

    ![A table showing the aforementioned information.](Images/forensics_day3_4.png)

### 05. Activity: Peter's Email Evidence

- In this activity, you will use Autopsy to view Peter's email correspondence and generate a list of contacts and their email addresses.

- You will be assigned to work in a small group as part of a digital forensics team.

- You will create custom tags for the evidence in Autopsy.

- You will also document your findings using the Correspondence Evidence Worksheet.

- Remind students that these emails were exported to the `Mail/MessageData` directory during the warm-up activity, and this is where they can perform offline analysis.

- This will be a collaborative effort. Break the class up into small groups of three or four.

Use the following files to complete the activity:

- [Activity File: Peter's Email Evidence](Activities/05_Emails/Unsolved/README.md)
- [Correspondence Evidence Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zS-QDGYhMnbZZrwcapIrwdn73fUoh3MSkaZCcX-7LUM/edit?usp=sharing)

### 08. Peter's SMS Messages 

In our last activity, we were able to identify potential co-conspirators by analyzing Peter's emails.

We'll continue to search for more evidence by examining Peter's SMS messages.

- Note the following about **SMS**:

   - SMS messages are what you know as text messages. SMS stands for "short message service" and is a person-to-person communication method.

   - SMS messages can be no more than 160 characters.

   - SMS messages can and have been used in DoS attacks.

   - **Smishing** is the term used to refer to a social engineering attack performed using SMS messages.

#### Forensic Analysis of SMS Messages Demonstration

Now, you will perform a short demonstration to view the SMS entries contained in the iPhone image.

There are four methods we can use to view these entries:

**Method 1**

 1. From the **Tools** menu, select **File Search by Attribute**.

 1. Click the box next to **Name** and type `sms.db`.

 1. Click the **Search** button.

 1. Select `sms.db` from the **Listing** pane.

 1. Select the **Indexed Text** tab in the **Data Content** pane to see Peter's messages.

**Method 2**

Click the custom tag that you created earlier to load the `sms.db` file.

   - We can read this in the **Data Content** pane.

   ![An image showing the custom tag selected and the information within it displayed in the Data Content pane.](Images/forensics_day3_5.png)

**Method 3**

Since this is a database file, we can also use a tool like SQLite Browser to read the messages.

  ![An image showing the command.](Images/forensics_day3_6.png)

 - Navigate to **Browse Data** and then the **message** table.

   ![An image showing the message table under the Browse Data tab.](Images/forensics_day3_7.png)

**Method 4**

Alternatively, we can export the file and use a preview command to read the messages.  

 ![An image showing the messages in the preview command.](Images/forensics_day3_8.png)

- Note that with this method its a little more difficult to determine the messages and senders.
