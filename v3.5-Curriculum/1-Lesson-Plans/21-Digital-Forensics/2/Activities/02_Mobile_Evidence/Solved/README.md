#### Bonus
 
 Research the two types of IDs below and identify how they are used to identify mobile devices:
 
  - IMEI number
 
    - From [IMEI.com](https://www.imei.info/news/your-imei-number-will-tell-you-everything-about-your-iphone/):

      - Each Apple product is associated with its own unique identification number, known as an International Mobile Station Equipment Identity IMEI.

      - It bears detailed information about the phone, such as its model, brand, production date, and the manufacturer`s site.

      - Apple recently stopped printing the unique IMEI numbers on the back of each device, but they are still easily accessible in the "About" section of an iPhone's general settings.

      - These numbers can be used by phone companies to match a particular device to phone networks, aiding in the identification of callers. 
  
  - ICCID
 
    - From  [hologram.io](https://hologram.io/blog/whats-an-iccid-number-and-why-does-it-matter-for-cellular-iot/):
 
       - The integrated circuit card ID (ICCID) is a unqiue 19- or 20-digit number printed on a SIM card used to identify the card.
