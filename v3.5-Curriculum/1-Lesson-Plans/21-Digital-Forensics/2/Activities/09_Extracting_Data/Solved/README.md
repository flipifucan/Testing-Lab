## Solution Guide: Extracting Evidence for Offline Analysis

#### Single File Export
 
A senior investigative team member has asked you to `Export` the `history.db` file for offline analysis.
  
  1. Locate the `history.db` file in the iPhone image file.
 
  2. Extract the file to the `Export` directory

  3. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the `Export` directory.
 
  4. Run the following command: `sqlitebrowser history.db`.
 
  The SQLite DB Browser will open.
 
  5. Click the **Browse Data** tab.
 
  6. Select **history_vists** in the Table dropdown menu to reveal the call history.

**Bonus**
 
 - What is the command to launch and simultaneously open the call table?
 
    -  `sqlitebrowser -R -t history_visits history.db`
