## Activity File: Tagging the Evidence

In this activity, you will continue your role as a digital forensics investigator working on the Pure Gold CU case.

- As part of your daily routine, you regularly tag all evidence that you consider critical to the investigation.

- To help speed up your workflow, you will use default and custom tags to categorize and organize all files and folders.

- This will allow other team members to sort through large amounts of data quickly and prevent double work.

### Instructions 

1. Create custom tags for evidence that you deem relevant to the case, such as mail, IPs, address book, and SMS.

    - Use the [iPhone Forensic Image: Important Databases and Files](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MN4aTz8qsPh1SayR9LWKVNIGndLcSVrg1SPHj4NtVLs/edit) to select the content to tag. 

    - You can also bookmark and tag other files of interest.
