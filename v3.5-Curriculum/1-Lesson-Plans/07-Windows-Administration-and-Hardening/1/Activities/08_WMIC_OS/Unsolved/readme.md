## Activity File: Creating a Report with wmic Output

In this activity, you will continue in the role of junior system administrator at Good Corp, Inc.

- Your CIO wants you to run `wmic` queries to continue baselining the system, including the Windows edition and the build number.

- You have to retrieve a list of disk information details.  

- The CIO also wants you to append these results to your `report.txt` file.

Continue to use the Windows RDP Host machine as the `azadmin` user. Remember to navigate to the `reports` directory you created in the previous activity.

- **Note:** You may want to save all of your working commands to a text file for reference. This way, if you make a mistake, you can delete it easily and re-run the working commands.

### Instructions

1. Using one command, append the following `wmic` query to your `report.txt` file as one output:

     - Windows edition

     - Build number

     **Note:** You can run `wmic [alias] get /value` to see the different properties and values that can be retrieved from an alias. For example: `wmic os get /value`

2. Create a `wmic` query for each of the following aliases and append them to the report:

    - User account information (`useraccount`): Name, the user's security identifier (`sid`), and description.

        - **Note:** The security ID (`sid`) of each user account is used to identify the groups the user belongs to, set access control entries, and bind security descriptors to each user.

    - Login information (`netlogin`): Username (`caption`), number of times user has logged on, and last logon time.

        - **Note:**  The `LastLogon` format follows the `yyyy/MM/DD-HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSZ` date and time format. 

         - `.SSSSSSZ` are the milliseconds (`000000` in the output) and time zone (`-300` in the output). 

        - This part of the output follows the `SimpleDateFormat` protocol for date and time.

    - Windows Update information (`qfe`): Update name (`caption`), description, installation date, and hotfix ID. 

**Note:** Make sure you verify each output before using the `/APPEND:<filename>` switch to append it to your `report.txt` file.
